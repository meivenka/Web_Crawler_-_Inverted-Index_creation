1. I have used scrapy python.
2. pipelines.py -> has the code for writing into csv files:
    Makes it faster as it does not disturb the crawling spiders
    Goes very easy on the memory usage
3. items.py -> has the structure for the spider to handle
4. newsCrawler.py has the crawling rules for the crawler/spiders.
